JPA Intro
- JPA uses POJO simpler (preffered) than JDBC
- h2 database
- Repository extends CRUDRepository
	~ Easy CRUD Operation implementations
	~ No need to write queries(SQL) for common CRUD Operations (DELETE, POST, GET, ect.)
	~ Only need to write custom queries like findByName 
- Repository connects to Service which connects to Controller
	~ Queries implemented in CRUDRepository 
	~ Service implemented CRUD functions no major code (call to Repository call to CRUDRep handled boiler code)
	~ CRUD Operations Was implemented in Controller	
	~ Repository interface only listed custom CRUD functions required (no implementations)
