# React Class Notes (http://bit.ly/react-ibm)

- [Computer Setup: sent to you via email before class](https://handsonreact.com/docs/computer-setup)
- [Course Materials: handsonreact.com](https://handsonreact.com/docs)


## Introductions
- [Technical Background Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/P9QWZND)
- What does your name mean?
  - Craig McKeachie
  - First: Craig- Scottish Gaelic word creag, meaning "rock,"
  - Last: McKeachie- Owner of many horses
  
## How the Class Works
### Concepts
- Includes numerous demonstrations
- Step-by-step directions provided
- Demonstrations done:
  - Instructor and attendees together initially
  - Then attendees decide whether doing or watching and asking questions works best for them

### Labs
- Building an application one step at a time
- Hands-on for attendees
- Step-by-step directions
- If you miss lab or donâ€™t finish a lab, you can pickup on the next one
- Solution code provided
- In class time allocated, 1 hour in the middle of each day and 1 hour at the end of each day
  - For some people this will be enough time to do the labs
  - For most people there will not be enough time to complete all the labs in class
  - I understand we learn best by doing  
  - The normal class material is:
      - 2 days of demonstrations, live-coding and concept learning 
      - 1 day of hands-on labs
  -  3 days total has been compressed into a fast-paced 2 days with homework at IBM's request
     - 1.5 days 2 days of demonstrations, live-coding and concept learning 
     - .5 day of hands-on labs

## Supporting IE11

- [React App Polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-app-polyfill)
  - Start by confirming you did the steps in the readme on this page
- Additional Steps
  1. Update browserlist development settings:
  #### `package.json`
  ```diff
  "development": [
  +    "ie 11",
      "last 1 chrome version",
      "last 1 firefox version",
   ...   
  ```
  2. Fix npm audit issues and make sure you have the latest version of packages
  ```
  Ctrl+C stop any `npm start` from running
  npm audit fix
  delete `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` \\close VS Code before doing this so directory isn't locked
  npm install
  npm start
  ```
  3. Check if it works now (I think it will...if not do the next step)
